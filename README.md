# HR Analytics - Employee Attrition Analysis

### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition within an organization using HR analytics techniques. The goal is to gain insights into the factors that contribute to attrition and provide actionable recommendations for employee retention.
The project utilizes a dataset containing employee information such as age, gender, job role, performance ratings, and attrition status. The dataset is loaded into a SQL database for analysis.

### Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to analyze the factors contributing to employee attrition and develop insights to help the company understand and mitigate attrition. The project aims to answer the following questions:

* What is the overall attrition rate in the company?
* Are there any specific demographics or job roles that have higher attrition rates?
* What are the primary factors that influence attrition?
* Can we identify any patterns or trends in the attrition data?
* How can we predict employee attrition and identify employees at risk of leaving?

### SQL Server Implementation
The project utilizes SQL Server for data storage, analysis, and modeling. SQL queries are employed to perform data exploration, calculate attrition rates, and derive insights from the dataset. Additionally, logistic regression is applied to build a predictive model for employee attrition.
The SQL code includes steps for data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, modeling, and generating insights.

### Project Outcome
The project aims to provide valuable insights and actionable recommendations for addressing employee attrition within the organization. By analyzing the dataset, understanding the factors contributing to attrition, and building a predictive model, the project helps in:

* Identifying high-risk job roles and areas for improvement.
* Assessing the impact of demographic and performance-related factors on attrition.
* Enabling proactive measures to retain valuable employees.
* Providing a foundation for ongoing HR analytics and decision-making.

### Conclusion
The HR Analytics - Employee Attrition Analysis project provides a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition within an organization. By leveraging SQL Server and performing data exploration, modeling, and prediction, the project helps organizations gain insights into attrition factors and take proactive steps to improve employee retention.
